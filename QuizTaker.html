<PRE>
     use Quiz::Taker;
     my $Q=Quiz::Taker-&gt;new(FileName=&gt;&quot;sampleqa&quot;);
     my %Data=();
     my $rData=$Q-&gt;load(\%Data);
     my ($rQuestions,$rAnswers,$rLengths,$rRandoms)=$Q-&gt;generate(\%Data);
     $Q-&gt;test($rQuestions,$rAnswers,$rLengths,$rRandoms);</PRE>

<A HREF="#item_new"><CODE>new(&quot;FileName&quot;=&gt;&quot;FILENAME&quot;,&quot;Delimiter&quot;=&gt;&quot;Delimiter&quot;,Answer_Delimiter=&gt;&quot;Delimiter&quot;,Score=&gt;&quot;1&quot;);</CODE></A>
<P>This creates the Games::QuizTaker object and initializes it with two
parameters. The FileName parameter is required, and the Delimiter is
optional. The Delimiter is what is used to separate the question and
answers in the question file. If the Delimiter parameter isn't passed,
it will default to the pipe (``|'') character. The Answer_Delimiter is
used for questions that have more than one correct answer. If the
Answer_Delimiter parameter isn't passed, it will default to a space.
When answering the questions within the test that have more than one
answer, put a space between each answer. There is also a parameter called
Scores that also can be passed to the object. By default it is set to 1 and
will print out the final score of the quiz when done. It can be set to 0,
thus turning it off. This could be done when setting a script up as part of
a login script and giving a ``Question of the day''.</P>

<A HREF="#item_load"><CODE>$refHash=$QT-&gt;load(\%Data);</CODE></A>
<P>This function will load the hash with all of the questions and answers
from the file that you specify when you create the object. It also sets
another parameter within the $QT object called FileLength, which is the
total number of questions within the file. It will also check to see if
the _Answer_Delimiter parameter is the same as the _Delimiter parameter.
If they are the same, then the program will croak.</P>
<P></P>

<DD>
<A HREF="#item_generate"><CODE>($refHash1,$refHash2,$refHash3,$refArray1)=$QT-&gt;generate(\%Data,$Max);</CODE></A>
<P>This function will generate the 3 hashes and 1 array needed by the test
function. The first reference ($refHash1) are the questions that will be
asked by the test function. The second reference ($refHash2) are the answers
to those questions. The third reference ($refHash3) is the length of the
array that is the value for each key of $refHash1. And $refArray1 is a
sequence of random numbers that is generated from the total number of
questions ($Max) that you wish to answer. The $refArray1 is also randomized
further after its generation by the internal _shuffle function which is a
Fisher-Yates shuffle. If the maximum number of questions you wish to answer
on the quiz ($Max) is not passed to the function, it will default to the
maximum number of questions in the file (determined by the FileLength
parameter within the object. It will also set the Max_Questions parameter
within the object, which will be later used by the test function to keep
track of the number of questions printed out.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_test">test</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
<A HREF="#item_test"><CODE>$QT-&gt;test($refHash1,$refHash2,$refHash3,$refArray1);</CODE></A>
<P>This function will print out each question in the Questions hash, and wait
for a response. It will then match that response against the Answers hash.
If there is a match, it will keep track of the number of correct answers, and 
move on to the next question, other wise it will give the correct answer, and
go to the next question. After the last question, it will pass the number
correct and the max number of questions on the test to the _Final function,
which prints out your final score.</P>

<P>There is a single function available for debugging. When called, it will
print out the contents of the object and its parameters.
