Installation
============

Install this just like any other Perl module

	perl Makefile.PL
	make test
	make install

Question Files
==============

	There are two files called sampleqa and sample.csv that are
	provided with this module to provide for an example of how to
	write your own. The sampleqa file uses the pipe ( "|" ) character
	as a delimitor, and the sample.csv file is a comma separated values
	file.
